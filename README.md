# 🎧 Lofi Lounge  

A chill little website I made just to vibe. Animated background, cozy sounds like rain and vinyl crackle, and you can hook up your Spotify to it. That way, you can listen to your playlists while the site adds its own atmosphere around you.

It’s simple, clean, and made to get lost in.

## 🎛️ What You Can Do  

- Watch a cool looping background while you work, study, or just stare into the void  
- Turn on rain sounds or vinyl crackle whenever you feel like it  
- Connect your Spotify account and control your music directly from the page  
- See what track is playing without having to switch tabs  
- Pause, play, skip tracks while the lo-fi world keeps moving in the background

## 🎨 The Idea  

I was tired of switching between Spotify and YouTube lo-fi videos, so I made my own little corner. A spot where I can blast my playlists, add some rain, and just let it play. No distractions. No ugly buttons. Just vibes.

**That’s it.** Nothing fancy, just a place to chill.
